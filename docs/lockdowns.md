## How much is this exercise costing the economy?

## How can we get rid of the legislation that allows lockdown/lockups?

You should let your local senate member know what you feel about this situation.

Don't vote for power hungry people in the future (I know it will be hard since it is any politicians dream to control).

Vote for people with your interests in mind (hard to find I know).

## I do not enjoy life that much. I want more restrictions, what can I do?

Live in your bubble.

## Isn't the lockdowns more like lock ups?

Just shut up shitizen and do what you're told.

## It is always busy at the big stores, how is that?

Some people are more privileged than others and allowed to keep their business running. Big business wins.

## Does freedon mean I have to take risks in life?

Yes, freedom is not free. To be free will mean you as a THINKING person has to do a risk analysis in realtime.

## Does the government want to steal my money?

Yes. It's what they do. Without your money, they cannot increase their influence into your life and pay themselves.
