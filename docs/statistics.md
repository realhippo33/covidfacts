> Figure 3.1 below shows the number of male and female deaths contributing to the top 5 causes. The leading cause of death for males was coronary heart disease, accounting for 10,269 (13%) deaths. Dementia including Alzheimer disease was the leading cause of death for females, accounting for 8,973 (12%) deaths, followed by coronary heart disease (7,264; 10% of deaths). Cerebrovascular disease (which includes stroke), lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) make up the top 5 leading underlying causes of death in Australia in 2018 for males and females of all ages combined. For more leading causes of death by sex see Table S3.1.

No numbers have been released for 2019 OR 2020. Expect it to be delayed for a long time so you don't question the lockups and the economic price paid for 50 peoples life.

Expect to see higher suicide rates for 2020.
