## Can I conclude something from all this information

At the next election, do not vote for politicians not caring about destroying thousands of peoples life, businesses and mental health.

E.g. do not vote for:

- Gladys Berejiklian, Liberal
- The rest of the "Libral" party
- Labour party
- The Greens

Now that lockdowns/lockups of whole states have been tried and tested for about a year, voting for people that do not believe in the individual's freedom will
