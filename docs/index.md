No body knows for sure.

Some say a lab in China in the city of Wuhan, hence the first name given was the "Wuhan virus" or "china virus" (as is commonly done for viruses think Spanish Flu (Spain), Zika (Uganda), Ebola (Ebola river)).

Some say from bats. Remember SARS? The classic explanation for virus origins.
