## How do the COVID-19 tests work?

In Australia the RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) which basically measures an amplified sample.

The amplification is what is called the "cycle threshold" (CT).

The more cycles are used to amplify the higher rate of false-positives occur.
A CT higher than 25-30 is generally thought to be imprecise.

The 2nd link in the references section below gives a good overview of how a RT-PCR result is interpreted.

Notice how the green line on the right only starts showing after a CT of 36 and hits its "positive" threshold once 39 cycles have been executed.

The CT count is not reported on COVID-19 tests in Australia, you might be able to get it if you ask.
